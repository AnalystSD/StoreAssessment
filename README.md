# StoreAssessment
This Project is to display that I have a good understanding of SQL and can show that in  two statements in the SQL File.
This project just showcases that I'm able to use SQL on MySQL but I also know MSSQL on azure, PROC SQL on SAS, and much more if needed from work experience and at current job position.
The database for this script can be found at https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/ .
The first chunk of code displays which customers rented which film.
The second chunk of code shows how well the films are doing financially, how much revenue they brought for the store.
From this we can see that [BUCKET BROTHERHOOD, SCALAWAG DUCK, TRIP NEWTON, COMA HEAD] have been bringing in the most revenue, with high renting volume, and only bucket brotherhood has a high replacement cost.
Also, please read the notes in the SQL code itself too to know which is which.
